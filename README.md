# quantum-library-of-babel

A simple project with interesting implications. 

A page of text as described in Jorge Luis Borges' short story ['The Library of Babel'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel) is generated using [a source of quantum random bits](http://qrng.anu.edu.au/index.php) and we read it. Given the [Many-Worlds Interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation) of Quantum Mechanics, across the multiverse we just read every possible page of text you can generate in this way.

Here's hoping our universe get's one of the interesting ones.
